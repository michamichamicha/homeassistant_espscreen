**A touch screen for every room that you lay out yourself, and manage from Home Assistant.**

**Why.** Your phone is in the other room and a tablet on the wall is expensive. A small ESP32 touch
panel costs a fraction of that, sits on a table or in a wall box, and is always at hand for the
lights, the heating or the vacuum.

**What.** Firmware for two affordable panels, the 2.8-inch CYD and the 4-inch Guition, with up to
48 tiles over eight pages: lights, climate, blinds and curtains, the vacuum, media, the weather,
history graphs, clocks and timers. A tile can take the whole page, one big switch you push without
looking, and a tile can go to another page. An automation can put an alert on every screen when someone rings
the bell, and a Guition shows who is there with the doorbell camera's picture. A tap can run any
action Home Assistant has for a tile, and Dark mode suits a screen beside the bed.

**How.** ESP Screen Manager is an app inside Home Assistant. It flashes a new screen over USB, updates
it over Wi-Fi and sends it your tiles. Changing a screen is pick, drag and **Save & send**:
no reflash, no YAML to write, no blueprint, MQTT or token. Brightness, night hours and Dark mode can
also be changed on the screen or by an automation, and your own YAML for one screen survives every update.

## Installing from Home Assistant

### Which screen

| Screen | Resolution | Display / touch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CYD ESP32-2432S028 | 320 × 240 | ILI9341 / resistive XPT2046 |
| Guition ESP32-S3-4848S040, 4 inch | 480 × 480 | ST7701S RGB / capacitive GT911 |
| Guition JC8012P4A1, 10.1 inch | 1280 × 800 | MIPI-DSI / capacitive GSL3680 |

Use these exact board variants: similar-looking product names can have different
controllers or connectors. Wallbox relays are not controlled.
The firmware and built-in CLI are tested with **ESPHome 2026.6.2**.

### Do I need ESPHome?

**You don't need to install the separate ESPHome Device Builder app.**
ESP Screen Manager already includes the ESPHome CLI and can build firmware itself,
install it via USB or give you the file to put on the screen from your own computer,
and later update it wirelessly over OTA.

**You do need to pair the flashed screen via the ESPHome integration in HA.**
That pairing lives under **Settings → Devices & services**, not in the
App store. Add the discovered device there. If it doesn't appear automatically,
choose **Add integration → ESPHome** and enter the screen's IP address.
If asked for a key, use the `api.encryption.key` from your own device YAML,
and grant the device permission to perform Home Assistant actions.

| Component | Needed? | What for? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ESP Screen Manager app | Yes, for this installation route | Installing firmware, managing tiles, and sending current data to the screen |
| ESPHome Device Builder app | No, optional | Alternative editor and firmware installer; the same CLI is already in ESP Screens |
| ESPHome integration in HA | Yes, pair every screen | The connection between Home Assistant and the physical screen |

So a fresh installation without ESPHome Device Builder also works. If there's
no ESPHome `secrets.yaml` yet, our wizard asks for Wi-Fi once and
stores it locally. Existing Wi-Fi secrets are reused. API and OTA keys
are generated per new screen and stay in that device's own profile.

### Step by step

For Home Assistant Container (Docker) without the App store, follow [ESP Screens with Docker](docs/DOCKER.md).

For Home Assistant OS with Apps/Add-ons on **aarch64 or amd64**:

1. Open the App store and add this repository:
   `https://github.com/MaxGramser/homeassistant_espscreen`.
2. Install **ESP Screen Manager**, start the app, and open **ESP Screens**.
   ESPHome Device Builder is optional: the ESPHome CLI is already in this app.
3. Connect the screen with a USB data cable to the **Home Assistant machine**
   and choose **New screen** in the sidebar: CYD, 4-inch Guition, or 10.1-inch JC8012P4A1, a name, the USB port, and
   **Install**. If Wi-Fi is missing from the ESPHome `secrets.yaml`, the window
   asks for it once and ESP Screens only adds the missing lines. The profile
   with unique API and OTA keys goes into the ESPHome folder; the build
   and flash run in the same window (a first build takes a few minutes on a
   Raspberry Pi). Each screen gets its own profile.
   Is Home Assistant on a server or in a virtual machine, out of reach of the screen?
   Choose **Download** under **Install via**: ESP Screens builds the firmware, and you put it
   on the screen from your own computer with [ESPHome Web](https://web.esphome.io) in Chrome
   or Edge. After that, updates go over Wi-Fi as usual.
4. **CYD:** go through the calibration on the screen. **4-inch Guition:** uses GT911.
   **JC8012P4A1:** uses GSL3680. Both Guition variants report pixel coordinates
   without resistive calibration. Then pair the discovered ESPHome device in
   **Settings → Devices & services** using the API key the window
   shows after installation (copy button). Grant the device permission to
   perform Home Assistant actions.
5. Select the screen in ESP Screens, choose your tiles, and click
   **Save & send**. Then test the physical controls.

  <img src="docs/images/editor-tiles.png" width="59%" alt="Choosing tiles: the pages of the screen side by side, next to the library with its search and filters">
</p>
<p align="center"><sub>New screen (step 3) and choosing your tiles (step 5).</sub></p>

You can install new firmware later from **Firmware & USB → Wi-Fi / OTA** in the sidebar.
For an existing screen, always use the existing profile; creating a new
installation profile generates new keys.

The [complete installation guide](docs/EASY_SETUP.md) walks through every step in more detail.
